//*** Issue / Solution ***//
//Denied of Service issue: In the distribute() function using send avoid a type of DoS
//However if one of several refunds fail, the user will not be able to claim this fund by itself.
//The solution must be to used pull over push payment, or just added a pull function to the contract

//*** Exercise 13 ***//
// Each player tries to guess the average of all the player's revealed answers combined.
// They must pay 1 ETH to play.
// The winners are those who are the nearest from the average.
// Note that some players may not reveal and use multiple accounts, this is part of the game and can be used tactically.
// Also note that waiting the last minute to reveal is also part of the game and can be used tactically (but it would probably cost a lot of gas).
